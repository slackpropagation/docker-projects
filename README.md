# Repository Overview

This repository contains my hands-on project work involving Docker and containerization, developed as part of my backend and full-stack application training.  
The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate my ability to build, configure, and deploy containerized applications in realistic development workflows.  
Through this work, I practiced key containerization concepts such as writing efficient Dockerfiles, setting up multi-container systems, configuring backend-to-database communication inside containers, and preparing applications for production and cloud deployment environments.  
These projects strengthened my understanding of container orchestration fundamentals and taught me how to troubleshoot, document, and optimize containerized systems â€” skills essential for modern software development.
